# Orchestration Log: Talyllyn

**Role:** Lead  
**Date:** 2026-02-27T06:48Z  
**Task:** ApiExplorer.fs Decomposition Plan  

## Work Completed

1. **Analyzed ApiExplorer.fs structure** — 1046 lines containing entire MVU stack
2. **Produced 5-file decomposition plan** with logical grouping:
   - File 1: Model, Msg, init (~90 lines)
   - File 2: Pure helpers (~100 lines)
   - File 3: Shared state + async commands (~150 lines)
   - File 4: update function (~215 lines)
   - File 5: All views (~530 lines)
3. **Identified gotchas and risk mitigation:**
   - currentSubscription mutable state read from views (architectural anti-pattern, pragmatic workaround noted)
   - private → internal visibility migration (safe via existing InternalsVisibleTo)
   - Cross-module dependencies (endpointKey, getLocoBindings shared between update and views)
   - Test file reference updates required
4. **Documented execution checklist** for executor (Tom Rolt)
5. **Wrote plan to** `.squad/decisions/inbox/talyllyn-apiexplorer-decomposition.md`

## Output

- Decision: Approved for execution
- Executor: Tom Rolt (UI Dev)
- Expected outcome: 1046-line file split into 5 focused files, 200 tests passing, merged to main
