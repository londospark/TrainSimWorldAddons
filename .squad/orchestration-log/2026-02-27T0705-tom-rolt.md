# Orchestration Log — Tom Rolt

**Date:** 2026-02-27T07:05Z  
**Agent:** Tom Rolt (UI Dev)  
**Task:** Application Screen Refactor  
**Branch:** feature/application-screen-refactor  
**PR:** #29 (merged to main)

## Casting & Skill Allocation

- **Tom Rolt (UI Dev)** — Refactor & component decomposition
- **Talyllyn (Lead)** — Charter/oversight (background)

## Session Flow

### Phase 1: Understanding Scope (Pre-work)
Identified `ApiExplorer.fs` (1046 lines) still contained raw MVU even after prior decomposition. AppHost needed Application-level screen abstraction above explorer, tree, and serial ports.

### Phase 2: Rename & Reorganization
1. Renamed `ApiExplorer` → `ApplicationScreen` (semantic clarity)
2. Created `ApplicationScreen/` folder structure
3. Moved and split 11 related files:
   - `ApiExplorer.fs` → `ApplicationScreen/Core.fs` (model, msg, init)
   - `ApiExplorerHelpers.fs` → `ApplicationScreen/Helpers.fs`
   - `ApiExplorerCommands.fs` → `ApplicationScreen/Commands.fs`
   - `ApiExplorerUpdate.fs` → `ApplicationScreen/Update.fs`
   - `ApiExplorerViews.fs` → `ApplicationScreen/Views.fs`
   - 6 view/component files split from Views.fs

### Phase 3: Component Extraction
Extracted 7 focused view components with extracted helper functions:
- ExplorerPanel.fs (tree navigation UI)
- SerialPortPanel.fs (serial connection UI)
- LocoBindingPanel.fs (loco binding UI)
- SubscriptionPanel.fs (subscription UI)
- ResponsePanel.fs (API response display)
- ToolbarPanel.fs (toolbar/actions)
- StatusPanel.fs (status bar)

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- Ran full build: ✅ Clean
- Ran test suite: ✅ 200 tests pass (includes ApiExplorerUpdateTests renamed scope)
- Checked all imports & call sites

### Phase 5: Merge to Main
- Committed to `feature/application-screen-refactor`
- Merged to `develop`
- Pushed
- PR #29 merged to main
