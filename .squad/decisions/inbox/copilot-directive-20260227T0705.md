**By:** LondoSpark (via Copilot)
**What:** "It's not the API explorer anymore, it's the application screen." Rename ApiExplorer to ApplicationScreen. Files sharing a prefix deserve their own folder. Views should be split into components to reduce nesting.
**Why:** User request — naming clarity, folder organization, component-based UI architecture.
